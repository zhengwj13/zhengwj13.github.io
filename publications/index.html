      <p>A recent runtime analysis (Zheng, Liu, Doerr (2022)) has shown that a variant of the NSGA-II algorithm can efficiently compute the full Pareto front of the OneMinMax problem when the population size is by a constant factor larger than the Pareto front, but that this is not possible when the population size is only equal to the Pareto front size. In this work, we analyze how well the NSGA-II approximates the Pareto front when it cannot compute the whole front. We observe experimentally and by mathematical means that already when the population size is half the Pareto front size, relatively large gaps in the Pareto front remain. The reason for this phenomenon is that the NSGA-II in the selection stage computes the crowding distance once and then repeatedly removes individuals with smallest crowding distance without updating the crowding distance after each removal. We propose an efficient way to implement the NSGA-II using the momentary crowding distance. In our experiments, this algorithm approximates the Pareto front much better than the previous version. We also prove that the gaps in the Pareto front are at most a constant factor larger than the theoretical minimum.</p>

      <p>The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is the most intensively used multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) in real-world applications. However, in contrast to several simple MOEAs analyzed also via mathematical means, no such study exists for the NSGA-II so far. In this work, we show that mathematical runtime analyses are feasible also for the NSGA-II. As particular results, we prove that with a population size larger than the Pareto front size by a constant factor, the NSGA-II with two classic mutation operators and three different ways to select the parents satisfies the same asymptotic runtime guarantees as the SEMO and GSEMO algorithms on the basic OneMinMax and LOTZ benchmark functions. However, if the population size is only equal to the size of the Pareto front, then the NSGA-II cannot efficiently compute the full Pareto front (for an exponential number of iterations, the population will always miss a constant fraction of the Pareto front). Our experiments confirm the above findings.</p>

      <p>Choosing a suitable algorithm from the myriads of different search heuristics is difficult when faced with a novel optimization problem. In this work, we argue that the purely academic question of what could be the best possible algorithm in a certain broad class of black-box optimizers can give fruitful indications in which direction to search for good established optimization heuristics. We demonstrate this approach on the recently proposed DLB benchmark, for which the only known results are O(n^3) runtimes for several classic evolutionary algorithms and an O(n^2 log n) runtime for an estimation-of-distribution algorithm. Our finding that the unary unbiased black-box complexity is only O(n^2) suggests the Metropolis algorithm as an interesting candidate and we prove that it solves the DLB problem in quadratic time. Since we also prove that better runtimes cannot be obtained in the class of unary unbiased algorithms, we shift our attention to algorithms that use the information of more parents to generate new solutions. An artificial algorithm of this type having an O(n log n) runtime leads to the result that the significance-based compact genetic algorithm (sig-cGA) can solve the DLB problem also in time O(n log n). Our experiments show a remarkably good performance of the Metropolis algorithm, clearly the best of all algorithms regarded for reasonable problem sizes.</p>

However, only two elitist algorithms (1 + 1) EA and (Œº + 1) EA are analyzed, and it is unknown whether the non-elitism mechanism could help to escape the local optima existed in OneMax(0,1n). In general, there are few theoretical results on the benefits of the non-elitism in evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we analyze on the influence of the non-elitism via comparing the performance of the elitist (1 + Œª) EA and its non-elitist counterpart (1, Œª) EA. We prove that with probability 1 - o(1) (1 + Œª) EA will get stuck in the local optima and cannot find the global optimum, but with probability 1, (1, Œª) EA can reach the global optimum and its expected runtime is O(n^3+c log n) with Œª=c\log_e/(e-1) n for the constant c ‚â• 1. Noting that a smaller offspring size is helpful for escaping from the local optima, we further resort to the compact genetic algorithm where only two individuals are sampled to update the probabilistic model, and prove its expected runtime of O(n^3 log n). Our computational experiments also verify the efficiency of the two non-elitist algorithms.</p>

      <p>In real-world applications, many optimization problems have the time-linkage property, that is, the objective function value relies on the current solution as well as the historical solutions. Although the rigorous theoretical analysis on evolutionary algorithms has rapidly developed in recent two decades, it remains an open problem to theoretically understand the behaviors of evolutionary algorithms on timelinkage problems. This paper takes the first step to rigorously analyze evolutionary algorithms for timelinkage functions. Based on the basic OneMax function, we propose a time-linkage function where the first bit value of the last time step is integrated but has a different preference from the current first bit. We prove that with probability 1 ‚Äì o(1), randomized local search and (1 + 1) EA cannot find the optimum, and with probability 1‚Äìo(1), (Œº+1) EA is able to reach the optimum.</p>

      <p>Previous theory work on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms considers mostly easy problems that are composed of unimodal objectives. This paper takes a first step towards a deeper understanding of how evolutionary algorithms solve multi-modal multi-objective problems. We propose the OneJumpZeroJump problem, a bi-objective problem whose single objectives are isomorphic to the classic jump functions benchmark. We prove that the simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (SEMO) cannot compute the full Pareto front. In contrast, for all problem sizes n and all jump sizes k in [4..n/2-1], the global SEMO (GSEMO) covers the Pareto front in Œò((n-2k)n^k) iterations in expectation. To improve the performance, we combine the GSEMO with two approaches, a heavy-tailed mutation operator and a stagnation detection strategy, that showed advantages in single-objective multi-modal problems. Runtime improvements of asymptotic order at least k^Œ©(k) are shown for both strategies. Our experiments verify the substantial runtime gains already for moderate problem sizes. Overall, these results show that the ideas recently developed for single-objective evolutionary algorithms can be effectively employed also in multi-objective optimization.</p>

      <p>One of the key difficulties in using estimation-of-distribution algorithms is choosing the population sizes appropriately: Too small values lead to genetic drift, which can cause enormous difficulties. In the regime with no genetic drift, however, often the runtime is roughly proportional to the population size, which renders large population sizes inefficient.
Based on a recent quantitative analysis which population sizes lead to genetic drift, we propose a parameter-less version of the compact genetic algorithm that automatically finds a suitable population size without spending too much time in situations unfavorable due to genetic drift.
We prove an easy mathematical runtime guarantee for this algorithm and conduct an extensive experimental analysis on four classic benchmark problems. The former shows that under a natural assumption, our algorithm has a performance similar to the one obtainable from the best population size. The latter confirms that missing the right population size can be highly detrimental and shows that our algorithm as well as a previously proposed parameter-less one based on parallel runs avoids such pitfalls. Comparing the two approaches, ours profits from its ability to abort runs which are likely to be stuck in a genetic drift situation.</p>

      <p>Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a successful branch of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that evolve a probabilistic model instead of a population. Analogous to genetic drift in EAs, EDAs also encounter the phenomenon that the random sampling in the model update can move the sampling frequencies to boundary values not justified by the fitness. This can result in a considerable performance loss. This article gives the first tight quantification of this effect for three EDAs and one ant colony optimizer, namely, for the univariate marginal distribution algorithm, the compact genetic algorithm, population-based incremental learning, and the max-min ant system with iteration-best update. Our results allow to choose the parameters of these algorithms in such a way that within a desired runtime, no sampling frequency approaches the boundary values without a clear indication from the objective function.</p>

      <p>We conduct a first fundamental analysis of the working principles of binary differential evolution (BDE), an optimization heuristic for binary decision variables that was derived by Gong and Tuson (2007) from the very successful classic differential evolution (DE) for continuous optimization. We show that unlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that neutral bit values are sampled with probability close to 1/2 for a long time. This is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the optima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function. This can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when optimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax. On the positive side, BDE quickly detects and optimizes the most important decision variables. For example, dominant bits converge to the optimal value in time logarithmic in the population size. This enables BDE to optimize the most important bits very fast. Overall, our results indicate that BDE is an interesting optimization paradigm having characteristics significantly different from classic evolutionary algorithms or estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs). On the technical side, we observe that the strong stochastic dependencies in the random experiment describing a run of BDE prevent us from proving all desired results with the mathematical rigor that was successfully used in the analysis of other evolutionary algorithms. Inspired by mean-field approaches in statistical physics we propose a more independent variant of BDE, show experimentally its similarity to BDE, and prove some statements rigorously only for the independent variant. Such a semi-rigorous approach might be interesting for other problems in evolutionary computation where purely mathematical methods failed so far.</p>
